# Basic Calculator ðŸ§®
### A Simple SwiftUI Beginner Project

This covers basic Swift elements like enums and numeric operations. 
Likewise, it isn't 'clean' code and contains several mistakes (as the 'negative' operation doesn't work properly).
I'll make changes in its appearance and hopefully fix that malfunction, but anyone with greater experience is more than welcomed to do so too. :3
